## Design Decisions

I decided to go with a Next Js app as it the recommended way to create react apps as advised by the react docs https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project

This project was made using node: v16.13.2
Make sure you have this version of node installed before installing dependencies and running the development server.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. It might take a second to see anything displayed.

## Coloring Options

Use the coloring options to control point colors

## Frames

Use the frame scrubber to select frames

## Labels

Use the labels checkbox to turn on labels

## Trails

Turn on all trails or individual box trails. Move the frame scrubber to add/remove trails for different frames depending on the selected boxes.
